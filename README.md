#Advent of Code 2016

Welcome to my attempts at completing the challenges set forth by [Eric Wastl's](http://was.tl/) [Advent of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016/).

I will be using various languages and styles throughout the season. All work is being done on Windows, though I intend to have some fun and try implementing solutions for some of the problems on other platforms, like Android.

To run the code here, you're going to need a compiler, interpreter or SDK for the following languages and platforms:

* [Python](https://python.org) - Comes installed on most Liux distributions and all Mac systems. Windows users will have to install it.
* [Go](https://golang.org) - From Google, this is my favorite language. Works on all platforms.
* [C#](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) - The easiest way to work with C# is with Visual Studio on Windows. That is literally what it's designed for. There are, however, other options, like [Mono Develop](http://www.monodevelop.com/)
* [Android](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) - While I typically use [Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/) to build my Android apps, I will use Android Studio for the purposes of this project.
* C and C++ - For these you're going to have to find your own compiler. It's very different for each platform, and it's likely that you already know what you're looking for if you want to compile a basic C program. :)
* JavaScript - Nothing special required for this: Just run it in your browser!
